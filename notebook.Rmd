# Problem
Squint surgery in adults is commonly considered as aesthetic surgery and therefore not covered by statutory health insurance. We aim to show that squint in adults has a significant impact on social life and business and corrective surgery should be included in standard insurance benefits.

To show the negative impact of strabismus we collect Likert-type data using a validated questionnaire distributed over the Internet.

## Experiment

### Stimulus persons

Stimulus persons were created by merging two faces together, the base (normal) pictures are used by courtesy of Prof. Martin Gr√ºndl from [Beautycheck](http://www.beautycheck.de). The faces were then modified having exophoria (**why?**), acne, eyebrow piercing or temporal tattoo with [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html).

| Face | Normal (0)                     | Strabismus (1)                 | Acne (2)                       | Piercing (3)                     | Tattoo (4)                     |
|:----:|:------------------------------:|:------------------------------:|:------------------------------:|:------------------------------:|:------------------------------:|
|   A  | ![Face A0](../pictures/A0.jpg) | ![Face A1](../pictures/A1.jpg) | ![Face A2](../pictures/A2.jpg) | ![Face A3](../pictures/A3.jpg) | ![Face A4](../pictures/A4.jpg) |

### Survey structure

Participants were allocated first to either getting an appendectomy or having a medical checkup (variable `situation`) with a probability of 0.5 each. They were subsequently allocated to one of five treatment groups (variable `trt_group`) being 0 the control group with a probability of 0.2 each. The participants were shown four pictures according to the following order:

| Treatment group |    |    |    |    |
|:----------------|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 0 (Control)     | A0 | B0 | C0 | D0 |
| 1               | A1 | B2 | C3 | D4 |
| 2               | A2 | B3 | C4 | D1 |
| 3               | A3 | B4 | C1 | D2 |
| 4               | A4 | B1 | C2 | D3 |

Table: Picture order by treatment group

For every picture, participants were asked, how likely they would have the operation or checkup performed by this physician on a Likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 10 (definitely) (variable `answer`). They also had to rate the shown physician regarding their perceived reliability, honesty, attractiveness, intelligence, compentence and kindness, again on a Likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 10 (maximal). Lastly, they were asked to rate the importance of the aforementioned characteristics in a surgeon or internist respectively, again on the same Likert scale.

### Data collection

Data was collected using an Internet-based [survey form](http://survey.jerney.ch), which has been programmed with the [CodeIgniter](https://www.codeigniter.com) framework. Demographic data involved gender, age and nationality. To be able to recognise double respondents, the IP address was registered, as well as the date and start/end time. Lastly, the admission mode (email, another website) was collected.


## Results

### Data cleaning

Data was exported from website database as comma-separated text (CSV) into a participant and an answers file. Both files were imported into [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com), a statistical computing environment based on [R](https://www.r-project.org/), with the help of the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages.

Exclusion criteria for participants were missing values, age lower than 16 or greater than 99 and an answer duration lower than 93 seconds or greater than 467 seconds (**why?**).

```{r date_summary, echo=FALSE}
participants_all <-
  read_rds(path = path_wd('empirical', '2_pipeline', '0_get_data', 'out', 'participants_all.rds'))

participants_all %>%
  modify_at(vars(date), as_date) %>%
  summarise(`Earliest` = min(date), `Latest` = max(date)) %>%
  kable(caption = "Start and end date of collected data", format = "pandoc")
```

### Demographics

```{r table_one,echo=FALSE,cache=FALSE}
tableone.participants <-
  read_rds(path = path_wd('empirical', '2_pipeline', '1_make_table_one', 'out', 'participants_tableone.rds'))

(
  kableone.participants <-
  tableone.participants %>%
  print(., nonnormal = c("age", "duration"), printToggle = FALSE, noSpaces = TRUE) %>%
  kable(caption = "Participant baseline characteristics", format = "pandoc")
)
```
